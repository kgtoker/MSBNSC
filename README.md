# MSBNSC
This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing the "Multi-Scale Superpixel Based Nearest Subspace Classifier For Hyperspectral Images." 

Usage
To utilize this code, follow these steps:

1. Download the (Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation) ERS Code:
    * Access the ERS code from the following URL:
https://github.com/mingyuliutw/EntropyRateSuperpixel
    * Download the code from the provided link.

2. Organize ERS Code:
    * Place the downloaded ERS code files into a subfolder named "Entropy Rate Superpixel Segmentation" within your project directory.
  
3. Download the mucilage dataset provided below link and place it into the folder with the same directory of MSBNSC.m.
   
   * You can download the mucilage dataset as a mat file to use in Matlab from Google Drive by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Is062SwtxdFiwFcy_47Qx6lxthIPuicw/view?usp=drive_link).

5. Run the Classifier: 
    * Use the main_MSBNSC_ALL.m to run the Multi-Scale Superpixel Based Nearest Subspace Classifier
  
Notes
* Ensure that the ERS code is correctly placed in the designated subfolder to enable seamless integration with the classifier.
* Refer to the documentation within the ERS repository for additional information on its usage and functionalities.
